fix: Simplify review query logic and fix copyright year

This commit fixes the review query logic based on PR feedback and
maintains the copyright year fix.

Bug Fixes:
- Fixed home page review query logic
  - Simplified to use single $or query instead of flawed try-except fallback
  - Empty query results don't raise exceptions, so exception handling was unnecessary
  - Now uses efficient single query that handles both string and ObjectId formats
  - Removed redundant fallback logic that would never execute
- Fixed copyright year displaying function object instead of actual year
  - Changed template helper from function reference to lambda
  - Ensures Jinja2 properly executes the function call
  - Copyright now dynamically displays current year (e.g., "© 2025")

Technical Details:
- Updated app/routes/public.py: Simplified review query to use $or directly
  - Removed unnecessary try-except block and nested if statements
  - Single query handles both string and ObjectId formats efficiently
- Updated app/templates_helpers.py: Changed current_year from function
  reference to lambda for proper Jinja2 template execution

Files Changed:
- app/routes/public.py: Simplified review query logic
- app/templates_helpers.py: Fixed copyright year template helper
