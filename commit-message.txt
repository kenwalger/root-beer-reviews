fix: Home page review display and copyright year rendering

This commit fixes two critical bugs that were preventing proper display
of content on the home page and footer.

Bug Fixes:
- Fixed home page not showing root beers with reviews
  - Improved review query logic to handle both string and ObjectId formats
  - Added fallback query strategies (try string first, then ObjectId)
  - Added comprehensive error handling and debug logging
  - Root beers with reviews now correctly appear on the homepage
- Fixed copyright year displaying function object instead of actual year
  - Changed template helper from function reference to lambda
  - Ensures Jinja2 properly executes the function call
  - Copyright now dynamically displays current year (e.g., "© 2025")

Technical Details:
- Updated app/routes/public.py: Enhanced review query with multiple
  fallback strategies and debug logging
- Updated app/templates_helpers.py: Changed current_year from function
  reference to lambda for proper Jinja2 template execution

Files Changed:
- app/routes/public.py: Improved review query logic and added logging
- app/templates_helpers.py: Fixed copyright year template helper
