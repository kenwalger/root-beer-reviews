Fix Heroku startup and make copyright year dynamic

This commit fixes the Heroku deployment startup failure and implements
dynamic copyright year in templates.

Heroku Deployment Fix:
- Made admin_email and admin_password optional in Settings model
- App can now start without these variables after initial admin user creation
- Prevents startup failures when admin credentials are not set in production
- Admin initialization gracefully skips if credentials are not provided
- Added informative log messages about skipping initialization

Dynamic Copyright Year:
- Created shared templates module (app/templates_helpers.py) with current_year global
- Updated all route files to use shared templates instance
- Changed copyright in base.html from hardcoded "2025" to dynamic {{ current_year }}
- Copyright year now automatically updates each year without code changes

Documentation Updates:
- Updated CHANGELOG.md dates from 2024-12-XX to 2025-12-30
- Updated README.md with note about optional admin credentials after initial setup
- Added entry to CHANGELOG documenting both fixes

Files Changed:
- app/config.py: Made admin_email and admin_password Optional[str] = None
- app/auth.py: Added check for credentials before initialization with logging
- app/templates_helpers.py: New shared templates module with current_year global
- app/routes/public.py: Updated to use shared templates
- app/routes/auth.py: Updated to use shared templates
- app/routes/admin.py: Updated to use shared templates
- app/templates/base.html: Changed copyright to use {{ current_year }}
- README.md: Added note about optional admin credentials
- CHANGELOG.md: Updated dates and added deployment fix entry

Impact:
- Heroku app can now start without ADMIN_EMAIL and ADMIN_PASSWORD set
- Initial admin user creation still works when credentials are provided
- Better error handling and user feedback
- Copyright year is always current without manual updates
- No breaking changes - existing deployments continue to work

This fixes the Heroku startup issue and improves maintainability by making
the copyright year dynamic.
