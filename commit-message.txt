Fix homepage review display and service worker caching strategy

This PR fixes a critical issue where the homepage was not displaying root beers with reviews due to service worker caching. The service worker was using a cache-first strategy that prevented the FastAPI route from executing, so reviews never appeared.

Key Changes:
- Changed service worker to use network-first strategy for homepage
  - Homepage now always fetches fresh data from server first
  - Service worker still caches response for offline use
  - Ensures reviews display correctly on every visit
- Removed homepage from initial cache list
- Bumped service worker cache version to v2 to clear old cached data
- Cleaned up excessive debug logging statements
- Fixed indentation issues in homepage route

The fix ensures that:
- Homepage route is always executed (visible in server logs)
- Reviews display correctly when they exist in the database
- Service worker still provides offline functionality
- Fresh data is always shown to users

Also updated ROADMAP.md to:
- Mark pagination as completed
- Add test suite as a high-priority feature
- Update completed features list
