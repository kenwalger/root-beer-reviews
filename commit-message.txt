fix: Improve S3 URL parsing and update documentation

This commit fixes the S3 URL parsing fallback logic by removing unreachable
code and updates documentation to reflect the image upload feature.

Bug Fixes:
- Removed unreachable condition in S3 URL parsing fallback logic
  - Removed check for `/amazonaws.com/` (path format) which never matches S3 URLs
  - S3 URLs use subdomain format (`.amazonaws.com/`) not path format
  - Simplified fallback logic to only check for valid S3 URL patterns

Improvements:
- Enhanced S3 URL parsing fallback logic to handle edge cases
  - More robust validation for S3 URLs
  - Better key extraction using `.amazonaws.com/` as delimiter
  - Handles bucket names containing ".s3." correctly
  - Improved error messages for invalid URLs

Documentation Updates:
- Updated CHANGELOG.md with URL parsing improvement
- Updated README.md:
  - Added image uploads to features list
  - Added S3 to tech stack
  - Removed "Image uploads" from roadmap (now completed)
  - Added S3 environment variables to .env example

Files Changed:
- app/utils/images.py: Improved URL parsing fallback logic with better validation
- CHANGELOG.md: Added URL parsing improvement to version 0.2.2
- README.md: Updated features, tech stack, roadmap, and environment variables
