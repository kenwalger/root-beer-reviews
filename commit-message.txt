fix: Add favicon route and document Tailwind CDN usage

This commit adds a favicon route handler and documents the Tailwind CDN
situation for future reference.

Bug Fixes:
- Added /favicon.ico route to resolve 404 errors
  - Browsers automatically request favicon.ico at root
  - Route serves favicon.ico if exists, otherwise falls back to icon-192x192.png
  - Eliminates console 404 error

Added:
- TAILWIND_CDN_NOTE.md: Documentation explaining Tailwind CDN usage
  - Explains current CDN setup is fine for MVP
  - Notes it should be addressed for production optimization
  - Provides context for the console warning

Improved:
- ROADMAP.md: Added "Production Tailwind CSS Setup" to lower priority features
  - Documents future optimization task
  - Includes implementation notes for PostCSS/CLI setup

Files Changed:
- app/main.py: Added /favicon.ico route handler
- TAILWIND_CDN_NOTE.md: New documentation file
- ROADMAP.md: Added Tailwind production setup task
