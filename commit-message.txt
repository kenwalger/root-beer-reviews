Fix Heroku startup: Make admin credentials optional

This commit fixes the Heroku deployment issue where the app fails to start
because ADMIN_EMAIL and ADMIN_PASSWORD are required but not set in Heroku
config vars.

Issue:
- App was crashing on Heroku with ValidationError for missing admin_email
  and admin_password fields
- These fields were marked as required in Settings model
- After initial admin user creation, these aren't needed anymore
- But the app couldn't start without them

Solution:
- Made admin_email and admin_password optional in Settings model
- Updated initialize_admin_user() to gracefully skip if credentials not provided
- Added informative log messages about skipping initialization
- App can now start without admin credentials after initial setup

Changes:
- app/config.py: Changed admin_email and admin_password to Optional[str] = None
- app/auth.py: Added check for credentials before initialization
- README.md: Added note about optional admin credentials after initial setup
- CHANGELOG.md: Documented the fix

Impact:
- Heroku app can now start without ADMIN_EMAIL and ADMIN_PASSWORD set
- Initial admin user creation still works when credentials are provided
- Better error handling and user feedback
- No breaking changes - existing deployments continue to work

This is a deployment fix that allows the app to start in production
environments where admin credentials may not be set after initial setup.
