Fix Heroku build: Remove requirements.txt, use uv exclusively

This commit fixes the Heroku build error by removing requirements.txt
and using uv as the exclusive package manager, as required by Heroku's
updated buildpack policy.

Issue Fixed:
- Heroku build was failing with error: "Multiple Python package manager
  files were found" (requirements.txt and uv.lock)
- Heroku's Python buildpack no longer supports implicit package manager
  selection (deprecated November 2024)
- Must explicitly choose one package manager

Solution:
- Removed requirements.txt file
- Project now uses uv exclusively via pyproject.toml and uv.lock
- All dependencies are defined in pyproject.toml
- uv.lock provides deterministic dependency resolution

Why uv:
- Project was already configured for uv
- uv is fast, actively maintained, and supports lockfiles
- Heroku's buildpack has native uv support
- Better dependency management with lockfiles

Changes:
- Deleted requirements.txt
- Updated README.md to use "uv sync" instead of "uv pip install -r requirements.txt"
- Updated SETUP.md to reflect uv-only installation
- Updated CHANGELOG.md with build fix note
- Updated project structure documentation

Documentation Updates:
- README.md: Changed installation instructions to "uv sync"
- README.md: Updated project structure to show uv.lock instead of requirements.txt
- README.md: Updated tech stack to show "uv (exclusive)"
- SETUP.md: Updated installation steps to use "uv sync"
- CHANGELOG.md: Added Heroku build fix entry

Impact:
- Heroku builds will now succeed
- Local development unchanged (already using uv)
- No functional changes to the application
- Cleaner dependency management with single source of truth (pyproject.toml)

This is a build/deployment fix with no impact on application functionality.
