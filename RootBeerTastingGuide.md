# Root Beer Tasting & Review Guide

This guide defines a **repeatable, consistent process** for tasting and reviewing root beer so that ratings remain comparable over time. It is designed for a single primary reviewer but can scale to multiple contributors in the future.

The goal is not to eliminate subjectivity, but to **control variables** and **separate observation from opinion**.

## 1. Preparation (Before Opening)

### 1.1 Environment

* Taste in a neutral environment
* Avoid strong smells (food, smoke, perfume)
* Avoid tasting immediately after brushing teeth or eating spicy foods

### 1.2 Temperature

* Chill the root beer to **38–42°F (3–6°C)**
* If possible, allow the bottle/can to rest upright for at least 30 minutes

Record deviations in the tasting notes if the serving temperature differs.

---

## 2. Glassware & Pouring

### 2.1 Glassware

* Use a clear glass whenever possible
* Preferred styles:

  * Small tumbler
  * Nonic pint (filled partially)

Avoid plastic or opaque cups when possible.

### 2.2 Pour Technique

* Open gently
* Pour down the side of the glass at a slight angle
* Allow a small head to form naturally

Observe:

* Initial carbonation release
* Foam height and persistence

---

## 3. Visual Assessment (Record Before Tasting)

Evaluate **without smelling or tasting yet**.

Record:

* Color (light brown, amber, dark brown, nearly black)
* Clarity (clear, slightly hazy, opaque)
* Bubble size (fine, medium, coarse)
* Foam (none, thin, creamy, persistent)

This informs carbonation and creaminess expectations.

---

## 4. Aroma Assessment

### Procedure

* Gently swirl the glass once
* Take 1–2 short sniffs

### Identify Aromas

Check for:

* Vanilla
* Sassafras / sarsaparilla
* Wintergreen
* Licorice / anise
* Caramel / molasses
* Spice (clove, cinnamon, nutmeg)
* Medicinal or herbal notes

Record **what is present**, not how much you like it.

---

## 5. First Sip (Structure Pass)

Take a small sip and let it coat the mouth.

Focus on structure, not flavor preference:

### Record Structured Ratings

* **Sweetness** (dry → very sweet)
* **Carbonation bite** (flat → aggressive)
* **Creaminess / mouthfeel** (thin → thick)
* **Acidity / sharpness** (soft → bright)

Do not score overall enjoyment yet.

---

## 6. Second Sip (Flavor Pass)

Take a normal sip.

Identify and record flavor notes:

* Herbal roots
* Vanilla or cream
* Spice
* Sweeteners (honey, molasses, caramel)
* Off-notes or medicinal qualities

Use flavor tags where possible.

---

## 7. Finish & Aftertaste

After swallowing, wait 5–10 seconds.

Evaluate:

* Aftertaste length (short, medium, long)
* Lingering sweetness or bitterness
* Changes in flavor

Record any late-emerging notes.

---

## 8. Overall Evaluation (Opinion Pass)

Only after completing structured observations:

* Assign **overall score**
* Answer **would drink again**
* Assess **uniqueness or memorability**

This separation helps prevent early bias from influencing sensory ratings.

---

## 9. Carbonation-Specific Guidance

When rating carbonation:

* Consider both **amount** and **bite**
* Fine bubbles may feel soft even at high carbonation
* Larger bubbles increase sharpness

Use:

* Sensory scale (1–5) for bite
* Low / Medium / High category for level
* Optional estimated CO₂ volumes (clearly labeled as estimates)

---

## 10. Consistency Rules

To maintain comparability:

* Taste only one new root beer per session when possible
* If tasting multiples, reset palate with water
* Avoid direct scoring comparisons during tasting
* Revisit calibration occasionally using a familiar reference brand

---

## 11. Recording Notes in the App

When entering data:

* Enter factual attributes first
* Enter structured ratings second
* Write tasting notes last
* Save before assigning overall score if possible

---

## 12. Philosophy

This system prioritizes:

* Repeatability over precision
* Description over judgment
* Transparency over false objectivity

Taste is subjective. Structure creates meaning.
